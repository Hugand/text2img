# Latent space visualization and Diffusion Decoder

The latent space is a compressed representation of the image being generated by the latent diffusion model. In lower resolutions, it doesn't give much information about the image itself to the human eye, but as it increases the image starts being more perceptible in this compressed space.

The Diffusion Decoder architecture is designed to concatenate the upsampled latent to the noisy image being fed into the U-Net. The upsampling can be done in two ways:

    1 - Via interpolation
    2 - By using a special conditioner to perform the upsampling

The latter approach could be useful to closely approximate the latent space to a more perceptible and detailed latent that will be used to reconstruct the original image. The first approach, even though more computationally more efficient, could make the reconstruction process more difficult since there is a lack of information in the latent. Even though the second approach is more computationally demanding, it could lead to better results since the latent would be more detailed.
